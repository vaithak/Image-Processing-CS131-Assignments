# Image-Processing-CS131-Assignments
This repository contains my solutions to first 4 assignments for the fall 2017 iteration of [CS 131](http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs131_fall1718/), a course at Stanford taught by [Juan Carlos Niebles](http://www.niebles.net) and [Ranjay Krishna](http://ranjaykrishna.com).

The assignments cover a wide range of topics in computer vision and should expose students to a broad range of concepts and applications.

* Homework 1 starts off the topics in computer vision by understanding concepts such as convolutions, linear systems and different kernels and how to design them to find certains signals in images. 
* Homework 2 focuses on edge detection, applying it to lane detection to aid self driving cars. 
* Homework 3 introduces SIFT and RANSAC, which are useful for finding corresponding points in multiple images, enabling applications like panorama creation, which is a common feature in most of our smart phones.
* Moving beyond pixels and edges, homework 4 takes a wider view of the image and asks students to use a dynamic programming algorithm to define the energy of certain regions in an image. This energy definition allows us to find regions that are important, enabling different monitors with varying sizes (large projections, medium laptop screens and small cell phones) to display only the important portions of an image. We specifically ask students to implements different versions of seam carving while preserving the structure of objects in images.
